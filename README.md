# pie-extensions/EXTENSION_NAME

PIE-compatible mirror of [UPSTREAM_OWNER/UPSTREAM_REPO](https://github.com/UPSTREAM_OWNER/UPSTREAM_REPO).

## Install

```bash
pie install pie-extensions/EXTENSION_NAME
```

## What is this?

This repository is an automated mirror that repackages the upstream PHP extension for installation via [PIE](https://github.com/php/pie) (PHP Installer for Extensions).

Releases are synced automatically from the upstream repository. Each release contains the unmodified upstream source code with a PIE-compatible `composer.json`.

## Supported platforms

Pre-built binaries are available for the following platforms:

| OS | Arch | libc | Notes |
|----|------|------|-------|
| Linux | x86_64 | glibc | |
| Linux | x86_64 | musl | Requires `libstdc++` and `libgcc` |
| Linux | arm64 | glibc | |
| Linux | arm64 | musl | Requires `libstdc++` and `libgcc` |
| macOS | x86_64 | - | |
| macOS | arm64 | - | |

> **Alpine Linux (musl):** Extensions that use C++ internally require the `libstdc++` and `libgcc` runtime packages, which are not included in minimal Alpine images. Install them with `apk add libstdc++ libgcc`.
